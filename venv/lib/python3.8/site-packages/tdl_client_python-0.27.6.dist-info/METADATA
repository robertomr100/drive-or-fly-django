# tdl-client-python Development

### Submodules

Project contains submodules as mentioned in the `.gitmodules` file:

- broker
- tdl/client (gets cloned into test/features)
- wiremock 

### Getting started

Requirements:
- `Python 3.10` (support for `Python 2.x` has been dropped)
- `pip` (ensure it supports `Python 3.10`)

Python client to connect to the central kata server.

Update submodules
```
git submodule update --init
```

Setting up a development environment:
```
python3 -m venv venv
. venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Your virtualenv will be created in `./venv/`


# Testing

#### Manual 

All test require the ActiveMQ broker to be started.
The following commands are available for the broker.

```
python ./broker/activemq-wrapper.py start
python wiremock/wiremock-wrapper.py start 41375
python wiremock/wiremock-wrapper.py start 8222
```

Stopping the above services would be the same, using the `stop` command instead of the `start` command.

#### Automatic (via script)

Start and stop the wiremocks and broker services with the below:
 
```bash
./startExternalDependencies.sh
``` 

```bash
./stopExternalDependencies.sh
``` 

# Cleanup

Stop external dependencies
```
python ./broker/activemq-wrapper.py stop
python wiremock/wiremock-wrapper.py stop 41375
python wiremock/wiremock-wrapper.py stop 8222
```

or

```bash
./stopExternalDependencies.sh
``` 

# Tests

Running all the tests,
```
$ behave
```

Pass arguments to behave, e.g. to run a specific scenario,

```
$ behave test/features/queue/QueueRunner.feature:154
```

or

```
$ behave -n "Process message then publish"
```

See `behave` [docs](https://python-behave.readthedocs.io/en/latest/behave.html) for more details.

## Distributable

Run the below to generate a distributable archive:

```bash
python3 -m build
```

The `tdl-client-python-x.xx.x.tar.gz` archive can be found in the `dist` folder.


# To release
